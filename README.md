# Code Description
Data Loading and Preprocessing: One CSV file was loaded, combined, and cleaned. This includes handling missing values, normalization, and encoding categorical features.
Data Splitting: The data is split into training, validation, and test sets.
Model Training: Several machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest for hyperparameter tuning. A deep learning model is also trained using Keras.
Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated on the test data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
